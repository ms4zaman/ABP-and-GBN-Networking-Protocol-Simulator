Alternating Bit Protocol and Go-Back-N are two retransmission protocols used within the link layer. This program generates a networking queue based upon input parameters and tests the selected protocol and captures network statistics on throughput vs. bit error rate.

The Scripts and Results folder has the CSV file results and scripts to execute. These are also located within the current folder that has this readme file.
